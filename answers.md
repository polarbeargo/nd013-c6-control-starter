* Add the plots to your report and explain them (describe what you see)  
  - The following figure shows the steering error and steering output. There are four parts of the timeline where the error becomes extremely large, these happened when the vehicle was avoiding a car in front of it and had to change its path. The oscillation also influences the error curve will require tweaking of the parameters.

* What is the effect of the PID according to the plots, how each part of the PID affects the control command?  

* How would you design a way to automatically tune the PID parameters?  

* PID controller is a model free controller, i.e. it does not use a model of the car. Could you explain the pros and cons of this type of controller?  

* (Optional) What would you do to improve the PID controller?
